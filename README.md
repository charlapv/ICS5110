ðŸ“œ Model Comparison
Model	Best For	Description
Linear Regression	Simple trends	Fits a straight line to the data
Polynomial Regression	Non-linear patterns	Uses higher-degree terms for flexibility
KNN Regression	Pattern-based data	Predicts based on nearest neighbors
Random Forests	Complex non-linear data	Uses multiple decision trees to make predictions
